            <h2>Setting up the overlay</h2>
            <p>
                On OBS, create a new Browser source. On the url, set this page's adress. Set your screen resolution as
                well (for example: width: 1920, height: 1080). No need to change anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have the source up and running, clip out the dashboard, leaving only the flowers visible.
                You can do so by holding alt and dragging the resize controls. In this case, you just want to use the
                bottom or up resizing points, so the width remains the same (The flowers will align themselves to the
                width of the page, according to the resolution you set beforehand).
            </p>
            <p>
                With the controls hidden, you can position the flowers as needed and start using the overlay.
            </p>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
                Once you set up the overlay, interact with it through OBS: Right-click on the browser source, and click
                on "interact". A new window will pop up. You can change the options here, and the changes will be
                displayed live on the overlay.
            </p>
            <h2>Using the controller</h2>
            <p>
                Instructions: First, set the size of the teams (from 1 to 5). Them, on the individual options, assign
                the characters for each team.
